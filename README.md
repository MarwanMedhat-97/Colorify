# Color-IT
Colorization is the process of addition of colour to a black and white video or image. A gray scale image is a scalar but A colored image is a vector valued function often represented as three separate channels. So, the colorization process requires mapping of a scalar to a vector (r,g,b) valued function which has no unique solution.
