# Colorify - Movie Colorization Application
Colorization is the process of the addition of color to a black and white video or image. A grayscale image is a scalar but A colored image is a vector-valued function often represented as three separate channels. So, the colorization process requires mapping of a scalar to a vector (r,g,b) valued function which has no unique solution.
Simply put, the mission of this project is to **Bring new life to old photos and movies**.
